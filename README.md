# DigitalCard
Digital card is an android application where you can store your paper business cards in the form of images.
In the application you can create your own business card in digital format which can be shared to other DigitalCard holders through QR code scanning.
All the cards(both images of paper cards and digital format cards) are stored in the internal memory of your android device.
